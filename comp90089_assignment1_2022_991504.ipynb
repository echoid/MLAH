Overall, the ICD code is more general and has a category called **other hypotension** to collect relative rare hypotension like Chronic hypotension. The SNOMED-CT is designed for input into EHRs, and the terms are pretty detailed for reporting. ICD-10 is a classification created for output or reports. Patients may be admitted to a hospital that uses ICD codes and then admitted to another that uses SNOMED-CT code, and vice versa.\n",

Thus we may find the cohort more accurate. We extracted data from ***mimiciv_icu.inputevents*** and ***mimiciv_icu.precedureevents***. Since the drug-taking event is the information documented for continuous infusions or intermittent administrations or Procedures documented. It is not patient outputs or recorded in a chart, so we won't consider ***outputevent and chartevent***. We named the cohort table as **drugs table**.\n",

        ">4. profound (e.g., vasopressor-dependent)\n",
        "> Here, we only consider the **Absolute** and **Relative**. \n",
        "Since the Orthostatic happens in a particular position or action, it is a bit hard to observe that. Also, we do not have much information about vasopressor-dependent. Thus the cohort who satisfied absolute criteria will be selected. To judge whether the patient have absolute or relative, we have to use three Blood Pressure measurements: **systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure** and **mean arterial pressure**\n",

        "5. **Find the item id for these Blood Pressure Measurements**\n",
        "> We find all labels that contains strings **\"systolic\", \"diastolic\" and \"arterial blood\"** from ***mimiciv_icu.d_items***. We got lots of relevant code, but we decided to choose the following code as our measurements:\n",
        ">* 220051      Arterial Blood Pressure diastolic\n",
        ">* 220052      Arterial Blood Pressure mean\n",

Thus, we keep the cohort with code **220051,220052,220050 and 220056** from ***mimicv_icu.chartevents***. We name the table as **bp table**.\n",
        "\n",

        "> Then, we did some data cleaning steps. We only keep patient identifiers **subject_id, hadm_id and stay_id** and the **time of Drug taking**for the drug table. For bp table, we keep patients identifiers **subject_id, hadm_id and stay_id**, \n",
        "the **type of measurement** and the **figure of measurements**. Then, we aim to make a timeline for each patient each stay. For each timeslot, event(s) happened(s). These events could be drug-taking or measuring blood pressure. Thus, we combine the two tables and order them by the patients' identifiers and time.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Label state for each timeslot**\n",
        "> For each stay patient, we have ordered all events in time. We want to label the state for each timeslot to judge if this patient meets this profound hypotension definition. We have three state labels **(Hypotension, Drug and Normal)**. We first label the state with the Drug, if the patient takes the Drug in this timeslot, then this will be labelled as **Drug**. Then, if the patient has blood pressure measurement, we will use the rule of **Absolute and Relative** to check if the patient is having Hypotension or not. We found the **Relative** needs a drop of Blood Pressure diastolic measurement, but this should happen spontaneously, which is quite challenging for us to catch, so we only keep the **Absolute** rule. If the systolic blood pressure is <90 mmHg and the mean arterial pressure is <65 mmHg, we will label this timeslot as **Hypotension**. Also, if an Arterial Blood Pressure Alarm - Low is recorded in this timeslot, we will also label this stage as **Hypotension**. Otherwise, we will label the rest of the timeslot as **Normal**. We also apply a filter to keep valid patients. The definition of profound Hypotension has three stages( Hypotension last>60min -> Take Drugs -> Blood Pressure Corrected)， which means it requires our patient to have all three labels(Hypotension, Drug and Normal). We apply a filter to keep patients who have all three labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Deal with conflict labels. Only keep one label for each timeslot**\n",
        "> We found the labels in each timeslot may have conflicts. For example, a patient has to mean arterial and systolic blood pressure simultaneously, but only systolic blood pressure measurement indicates Hypotension, and the mean arterial pressure measurement does not. If multiple events happen during this time, we will use the priority of **<Drug, Hypotension, Normal>** to label each timeslot. After that, each timeslot will only have one label to indicate the current stage.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Check if each patient for each stay is valid for check_profound_hypotension**\n",
        "> We built a function called check_profound_hypotension. We input each patient's data for each stay with a timeslot and the label for each timeslot, and then it will return a Boolean value to show if this patient for this stay is valid for profound Hypotension. As mentioned, profound Hypotension has three stages: **(Hypotension last>60min -> Take Drugs -> Blood Pressure Corrected)**. We iterate each timeslot. If the Hypotension label occurs, then we record the Hypotension start time. We keep doing the iteration and sum up all the Hypotension last time; if the last time is over 60 mins, that means the first stage is satisfied, then we will find the coming drug take label and record the time, and the second stage is done. After that, we will check if there is a Normal label after drug taking. If there is one, then all stages are complete, and we can see this patient in this stay meet the profound_hypotension and stop iteration to save time. Note that we have a constraint for the drug taking: we only see Drug taking as valid if it is taken within 90 mins after the first stage. Otherwise, we don't know if the Drug helps the patient recover or if they recover by themselves. We may need to do a further constraint about the drug effect time since it may need some time for a drug to correct blood pressure, and we do not know if the Drug did help for blood pressure correction. We do not have this actual effect time. Thus we will treat all corrections as the credit of the drug. After that, we build our cohort table, we keep the record of each patients' identifiers and also a True value to indicates they are valid for profound hypotension,. We aggrate all timeslot together so there is no \"remaining columns used for filtering\" for us to keep. \n",
        "\n",
        "11. **Extract patients' ICD Code**\n",
        "> We also need a column that states whether\n",
        "Any ICD code for hypotension was added to their list of diagnoses when they were discharged, and we use ***mimiciv_hosp.diagnoses_icd*** table to search all **icd_code** that like **(\"I95%\")** since all hypotension related code starts with **I95**. We name this table the ICD table, which contains the patients' identifiers **hadm_id** with codes like **I95** and their ICD codes.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **Link the ICD table and the Cohort Table**\n",
        "> We use **hadm_id** as the key, iterate each **hadm_id** from the Cohort table and check if this **hadm_id** occurs in the ICD table. It appears, we will label this **hadm_id** as True. Otherwise False. Then this boolean value will be added to our cohort table to get the final cohort table.\n",
